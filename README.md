Predict student exam scores based on hours studied using simple linear regression.

# Student Score Predictor (Linear Regression)

This project uses simple **linear regression** to predict student exam scores based on the number of hours they studied.

## Problem Statement

Can we predict a student’s exam score based on how many hours they studied?

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Student Scores Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv)
- **Features:**  
  - `Hours`: Number of hours studied  
  - `Scores`: Exam scores (percentage)

## Tools Used

- Python 🐍  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn

---

## Results

- ✅ **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 28.88  
- ✅ **R² Score:** 0.95  
- ✅ **Prediction:** A student studying **9.25 hours** is predicted to score **92.91**
